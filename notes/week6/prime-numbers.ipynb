    "Prime numbers are used in pseudo random number generation and hashing and all over computer science\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding Primes is difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime Number is only divisible by 1 and itself\n",

    "## RSA Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime numbers are vital for RSA Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "    - A key to **lock** (encrypt) which is **public**\n",
    "    - A key to **unlock** (decrypt) which is **private**\n",
    "  - The goal is to find 3 larg integars e, d, and n 0 <= m < n, (m^e)^d = m % n\n",
    "\n",
    "## So how do we find these prime numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rabin Miller Primality Test (helps you find primes fast but with a tiny chance that they are not)\n"
