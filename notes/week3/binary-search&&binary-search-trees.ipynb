    "## Binary Space Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- It things it is sometimes useful to be able to locate things relative to other objects in the environments\n",
    "- One way to do this is binary space partitioning\n",
    "  - To do this we need a plane P that divides a set of objects into two groups (left of P and right of P)\n",
    "  - The for each group we recusivily subdivide theam with planes until the number of elements is small enough to handle individually\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can perform nearest neighbor quieries on an ordered map that is in an array\n",
    "  - The array is sorted by key\n",
    "  - at each step the number of candidate items is halved\n",
    "  - it terminates after O(log n) steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "  1. You start with the middle value (example find 7 in 0-19 start with 8)\n",
    "  2. Check the value against what you are trying to find if its higher or lower throw out halve of the value of the side you dont need to search (throw away 8-17)\n",
    "  3. Then pick the other middle (now 3 and check that it is lower than 7 and throw out 0-3)\n",
    "  4. ... Keep going ...\n",
    "  5. Unitl you find the right number 7\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- A search table is an ordered map implemented by means of a sorted sequence\n",
    "  - sorted by key\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Performance:\n",
    "  - Takes O(log n) time\n",
    "  - inserting item takes O(n) time\n",
    "  - removing takes O(n) time\n",
    "\n",
    "## If the collection you are searching changes often use a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- O(log n) time for insert, remove, and find!\n",
    "- Not used very often but sorted trees are used very often like a B-tree\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- a binary tree holding keys value entries at its internal nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Search:\n",
    "  - To search for a key k\n",
    "  - and we trace a downward path\n",
    "  - the next node visited dpends on the comparision of k with the current node\n",
    "  - if we reach the leaf the key is not found\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion:\n",
    "  - To perform the put() operation we search for the key k\n",
    "\n",
    "Deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Range Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "- find all the elements within a range of keys (k1 <= k <= k2)\n",
    "- k1 and k2 can sometimes take you outside the range and then back into the range for the paths to to those nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# paste algorithm here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- At most 2s + 4h + 1 nodes of T are visted and the operation findAllInRange() runs O(h + s)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Index-Based Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "- New operation select(i) - What is the ith smallest key for 1 <= i <= n\n",
    "- You can use a stack, pointer, or an array to keep track of your path\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#paste algorithm for searching for the ith element (Search Algorithm)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Warning!! The Devil picks your inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you dont do anything to make your tree \"bushy\" and/or balanced you wont get that O(log n) time\n",
    "- You need a system that keeps your tree bushy no matter what you throw at it"
